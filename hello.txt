 computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs, which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, defining the structure and content of web pages. It uses tags to mark up text, images, and other multimedia elements, instructing a web browser how to display them. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it provides instructions for formatting and displaying content.
